(Rubin, 2023) This is probably best teased out via campaign contribution data - was only just released at 7 p.m. last night due to new legislation that expanded time for donors to remain nameless.

        "Another limitation is sample size - sample size in counties which do not use a county line primary balloting system is 2, versus 19 counties that do use this system. One possible way to work around this issue is do create matching variables for county codes, but then switch the unit of analysis to be municipalities within such counties to increase the size of population.\n",

Case analysis and qualitative interviews will likely be necessary to further unpack this possible relationship."
